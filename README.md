# Mutual_fund_analysis
Compare the Mutual Fund Returns against traditional self-investing in index funds. 

# Is Mutual funds via SIP the best way to accumulate wealth or is it just a marketing strategy to have a regular income for fund houses?

This question prevailed for so long in my head when I saw too many ads over the internet and TV about Mutual funds and SIPs the best way. 
What intrigued me is no one could give us surety of returns and highlight the risks of the market and also while managing the fund take the fees from our pocket. 

So, I went on the journey to validate the claims and check against the data that I could gather and make a simulation out of it.

We downloaded the data about BSE month over month and calculated the returns for the entire history. 

We provided the SIP details regarding the duration of the SIP, the amount of SIP, and returns you can expect in CAGR from a mutual fund. 

What we noticed is that the **BSE index performed better in most of the scenarios unless we make a 12% CAGR** return from a mutual Fund. 

As you notice below is the comparison of the two strategies over 10 year period.

# Conclusion-

We can use the Mutual funds to invest indirectly into the market and expect similar growth. However, if the mutual fund has been providing returns less than **12% CAGR** basis annually it is a more viable option to invest in BSE or NIFTY BEES which are the same as index mimicking.

If you can spend some time and invest logically you may tend to grow with the market rate make decent returns and save on mutual fund fees. 

# Note - 
The mutual fund expense ratio was kept at 0.5% which is the industry minimum and the exit load was 1% again the industry minimum. 
Should you increase those percentages, GST, and other taxes the total investment amount and the returns will differ.
