# Is Mutual funds via SIP the best way to accumulate wealth or is it just a marketing strategy to have a regular income for fund houses?

This question prevailed for so long in my head when I saw too many ads over the internet and TV about Mutual funds and SIPs the best way. 
What intrigued me is no one could give us surety of returns and highlight the risks of the market and also while managing the fund take the fees from our pocket. 

So, I went on the journey to validate the claims and check against the data that I could gather and make a simulation out of it.

We downloaded the data about BSE month over month and calculated the returns for the entire history. 
We provided the SIP details regarding the duration of the SIP, the amount of SIP, and returns you can expect in CAGR from a mutual fund. 


What we noticed is that BSE index performed better in the most of the scenario unless your mutual fund hits the home run with the staggering 18%
